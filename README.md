# KAIBURR_Task-5_Data-Science-example.
This project classifies consumer complaints into four categories: credit reporting, debt collection, consumer loan and mortgage. The implementation follows these steps: Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering, Text Pre-Processing, Selection of Multi-Classification Models, Comparison of Model Performance, Model Evaluation, and Prediction.

Steps Implemented
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
2. Text Pre-Processing (TF-IDF Vectorization)
3. Selection and Training of Multi-Classification Models
4. Logistic Regression
5. Multinomial Naive Bayes
6. Random Forest
7. SVM
8. Comparison of Model Performance
9. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)
10. Prediction on New Text Data

Libraries Used
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, MultinomialNB, RandomForestClassifier, SVC, TfidfVectorizer, train_test_split, accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix, resample)
